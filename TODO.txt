Website TODOs
=============

1. activities.html is not in the top nav (Home / About me / Now / Miscellaneous).
   It is only reachable via a small link at the bottom of the Talks section on the
   home page. Either add it to the nav on all pages, or fold its content into About.

2. The link in misc.html still points to master_advice.html:
     <a href="master_advice.html">Here</a>
   Now that the content lives as a blog post (blog/posts/maths-in-france.md),
   this should point to blog/post.html?post=maths-in-france instead.
   master_advice.html can then be deleted.

4. DONE — favicon.svg added to repo root and linked from all main pages.

5. Blog not linked from the main site nav yet (intentional for now).
   When ready, add it to the nav on all pages alongside Home / About me / Now /
   Miscellaneous, and update blog/index.html and blog/post.html accordingly.
