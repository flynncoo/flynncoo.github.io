# First post

*20 February 2026*

Welcome to my blog. I'll be writing here about mathematics, theoretical computer science, and whatever else comes to mind.

## What to expect

This blog will likely cover topics in homotopy theory, operads, categorical probability, and theoretical computer science; the things I work on day to day. I may also write about life as a mathematician.


## Testing latex

Here is a formula; just to check that my latex engine works.
Here is Euler's identity:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

And an inline equation: the Gaussian integral evaluates to $\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{\pi}$.

There will hopefully be more soon, although this is no less than the third time that I have attempted to write a blog.
