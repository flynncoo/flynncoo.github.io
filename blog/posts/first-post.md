# First post

*20 February 2026*

Welcome to my blog. It is 21h46, I'm currently sitting on a German train (at Oldenzaal according to my desktop) and heaing in the general direction of Bielefeld. That's when and where I had the bright idea of trying to start a blog; for no less than the third time.

I'll be writing here about mathematical life of course, and hopefully work some ideas and/or do some interesting calculations, of course, but I'm not really expecting that to be the main theme. To be perfectly honest, I'm not fully sure what the main theme will be - plausibly it will feature much navel-gazing.


## Testing latex

As there will be mathematics: here is Euler's identity to test that latex works!

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

And an inline equation: the Gaussian integral evaluates to $\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{\pi}$.
